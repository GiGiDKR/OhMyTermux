## **XFCE and Debian**

Set up a termux XFCE desktop and a Debian proot install.
This setup uses Termux-X11, the termux-x11 server will be installed and you will be prompted to allow termux to install the Android APK.
You only need to pick your username and follow the prompts.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This will take roughly 4GB of storage space

<details>
  
<summary>ðŸ§Š Starting the desktop</summary>

You will recieve a popup to allow installs from termux, this will open the APK for the Termux-X11 android app. While you do not have to allow installs from termux, you will still need to install manually by using a file browser and finding the APK in your downloads folder.

Use the command ```start``` to initiate a Termux-X11 session.

This will start the termux-x11 server, XFCE4 desktop and open the Termux-X11 app right into the desktop.

To enter the Debian proot install from terminal use the command ```debian```

Also note, you do not need to set display in Debian proot as it is already set. This means you can use the terminal to start any GUI application and it will startup.

</details>

<details>
  
<summary>ðŸ§Š Debain Proot</summary>

To enter proot use the command ```debian```, from there you can install aditional software with apt and use cp2menu in termux to copy the menu items over to termux xfce menu.

There are two scripts available for this setup as well :

```prun``` Â Running this followed by a command you want to run from the debian proot install will allow you to run stuff from the termux terminal without running ```debian``` to get into the proot itself.

```cp2menu``` Running this will pop up a window allowing you to copy .desktop files from debian proot into the termux xfce "start" menu so you won't need to launch them from terminal. A launcher is available in the System menu section.

<summary>How to fix this Termux error</summary>

You need to run this adb command to fix the process 9 error that will force close Termux :
```
adb shell "/system/bin/device_config put activity_manager max_phantom_processes 2147483647"
```
To do this without using a PC you have several methods :
First, Connect to WIFI.

**Method 1 :** 
Install adb in Termux by running this code:
```
pkg install android-tools -y
```
Then open settings and enable developer's options by selecting "About phone" then hit "Build" 7 times.

Back out of this menu and go into developer's options, enable wireless debugging then click into there to get the port number then click pair device to get the pairing code.

Put settings into split screen mode by pressing the square button on the bottom right of your phone, and hold the settings icon until the split screen icon shows up.

Then select Termux and in settings select pair with a code. In Termux type `adb pair` then enter your pairing info.

After you have completed this process you can type adb connect and connect to your phone with the ip and port provided in the wireless debugging menu. You can then run the fix command :

```adb shell "/system/bin/device_config put activity_manager max_phantom_processes 2147483647"```

**Method 2 :**

Install LADB from [Playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.draco.ladb) or from [GitHub](https://github.com/hyperio546/ladb-builds/releases).

In split screen have one side LADB and the other side showing developer settings.
In developer settings, enable wireless debugging then click into there to get the port number then click pair device to get the pairing code.
Enter both those values into LADB.
Once it connects run the fix command :

```adb shell "/system/bin/device_config put activity_manager max_phantom_processes 2147483647"```
