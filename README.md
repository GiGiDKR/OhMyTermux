ðŸ”¥ **XFCE and Debian :**

Sets up a termux XFCE desktop and a Debian proot install.
This setup uses Termux-X11, the termux-x11 server will be installed and you will be prompted to allow termux to install the Android APK.
You only need to pick your username and follow the prompts.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This will take roughly 4GB of storage space

---

## Starting the desktop

  

During install you will recieve a popup to allow installs from termux, this will open the APK for the Termux-X11 android app. While you do not have to allow installs from termux, you will still need to install manually by using a file browser and finding the APK in your downloads folder.

Use the command ```start``` to initiate a Termux-X11 session

This will start the termux-x11 server, XFCE4 desktop and open the Termux-X11 app right into the desktop.

  

To enter the Debian proot install from terminal use the command ```debian```

  

Also note, you do not need to set display in Debian proot as it is already set. This means you can use the terminal to start any GUI application and it will startup.

  

&nbsp;

  

## Debain Proot


To enter proot use the command ```debian```, from there you can install aditional software with apt and use cp2menu in termux to copy the menu items over to termux xfce menu.

&nbsp;


There are two scripts available for this setup as well

```prun``` Â Running this followed by a command you want to run from the debian proot install will allow you to run stuff from the termux terminal without running ```debian``` to get into the proot itself.

```cp2menu``` Running this will pop up a window allowing you to copy .desktop files from debian proot into the termux xfce "start" menu so you won't need to launch them from terminal. A launcher is available in the System menu section.
